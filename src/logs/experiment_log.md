# Experiments
1. GPU CPU speedup: Var: img_size, batch_size, e1 network, 3 episodes, 3 runs
2. GPU CPU speedup:  e2 network bigger than e1, 3 episodes, 3 runs
3. GPU CPU speedup:  e2 network, 3 episodes, 3 runs, pin memory in dataloader off
4. Compare random background vs default.
5. Squeezenet speedup GPU, 3 runs 3 episodes, batchsize 256 due to cuda memory errors at512
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory.
